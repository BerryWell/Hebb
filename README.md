# Introduction
Donal O. Hebb was a Canadian psychologist.

# Methods
I have implemented the simple Hebbian learning rule in the textbook. [1]
The input is a [1,2] list. The output list is calculated from weight. The result is either 'apple' or 'banana'.

# Results
It classifies the input correctly.

# Dicussion
This applicaion of Hebian learning is too simple. I experimented with only 2 inputs. Further works such as implementing more inputs, and training to optimize weights need to be implemented.
